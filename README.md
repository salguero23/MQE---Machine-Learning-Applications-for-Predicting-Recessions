Modern-day business cycles consist of expansionary and recessionary periods in the
economy. For economists and policymakers, it would be beneficial for the economy to generate
accurate forecasts for the economy. Accurate forecasts can mitigate future risk and shape effective
policy to target economic issues. This paper aims at using machine learning models such as
Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, and Recurrent Neural
Networks to generate accurate predictions for recessionary periods ranging from 1960 to 2020.
Economic data was gathered from Fred such as inflation, unemployment, and business confidence
to train and test these models yielding accuracy results as high as 97%. Although room for
improvement, these models are a steppingstone in generating accurate recessionary forecasts using
machine learning techniques.
